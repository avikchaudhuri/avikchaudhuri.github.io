	I am currently researching applications of machine learning to program analysis and transformation, with a particular focus on code optimization, where manual heuristics can be replaced by models. Specifically, I lead a team at Meta that is working on making tensor programs run faster on GPUs through improvements in the new PyTorch compiler stack (<a href="https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/torchinductor-a-pytorch-native-compiler-with-define-by-run-ir-and-symbolic-shapes/747">TorchInductor</a> + <a href="https://openai.com/blog/triton/">Triton</a>).
	</p>
<p style="margin: 0.5em;">
	Until recently I was leading an ambitious company-wide initiative to build a platform and ecosystem for end-to-end machine learning development at Meta, applying programming-language principles and techniques to solve fundamental productivity and governance problems. This included an expressive language for describing pipelines of data transformations with static verification, parallelization, memoization, and dependency tracking (think <a href="https://dagster.io/blog/introducing-dagster">Dagster</a> + <a href="https://pytorch.org/torcharrow/beta/index.html">TorchArrow</a>); over which standard interfaces and a marketplace of privacy-aware components were built for data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation; which in turn fed into tools that vastly improved experimentation and automation.  

	</p>
<p style="margin: 0.5em;">
	I also created <a href="https://flowtype.org">Flow</a>, a popular open-source type checker for JavaScript that is used by thousands of developers on millions of lines of code every day at Meta. Flow pioneered several advanced type inference idioms that were later adopted by other type systems for JavaScript, PHP, and Python, and is characterized by its focus on soundness and scalability.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.5em;">
	Before joining Meta, I was heavily involved in building the future of the ActionScript language and the Flash platform at Adobe, and for a while, served on the JavaScript standardization committee.

<p style="margin: 0.5em;">I have published research in many areas of programming languages, including type systems, concurrency control, logic, code optimization, and security analysis. Prior to joining the industry, I worked in the <a
href="https://plum-umd.github.io/">Programming Languages</a> group 
at University of Maryland as a post-doctoral research associate with <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jfoster/">Jeffrey Foster</a>. Between 2004 and 2008 I earned a PhD under the tutelage of <a
 href="https://research.google/people/abadi/">Mart&iacute;n
 Abadi</a>. Further back, I did
undergraduate studies in <a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in">Computer
Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.iitd.ernet.in">IIT
Delhi</a>,
where I was advised by <a
 href="http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~sanjiva">Sanjiva
Prasad</a>. In between, I have spent various summers at <a href="https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/india/default.aspx">MSR</a>, <a href="http://www.nicta.com.au/">NICTA</a>, and <a href="http://www.inria.fr/rocquencourt/home/view?set_language=en">INRIA</a>.</p>
